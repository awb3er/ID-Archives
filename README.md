# ID Archives

Plugin information etc. coming soon.

Basically, displays archives in a list.

Use `<?php echo id_archives(); ?>` in the templates or `[id-archives]` shortcode within the post.

## TODO

- Expand archive listing to custom post types.
- Maybe an admin page for markup editing.
- Options - date based filters etc.
